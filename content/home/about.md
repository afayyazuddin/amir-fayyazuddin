## About Me
My name is Amir Fayyazuddin. I studied Mathematics as an undergrad and then Neurobiology for my PhD both at the University of Chicago. My academic research focused on circuits and molecules underlying behavior using a variety of methods from genetics, molecular biology, and electrophysiology. Currently, I work in the biotech industry using a combination of genetics, genomics and computational techniques to identify drug targets and biomarkers.

If you have any data analysis problems that you would like help with please feel free to get in touch.
